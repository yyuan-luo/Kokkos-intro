- `Make build` to build the program
- `Make test` to build and run the program with default parameters
- `bash run.sh M N K` to run the program 10 times and calculate the average kernel FLOPS performan and average execution time. Assign `M`, `N`, `K` with some numbers you like or the program runs with default values
